# GUITAR-TUNER

The goal is to create a guitar tuner (in a platform namely MATLAB) which can be tuned anywhere, at any condition.
●	The important parameters for designing a guitar tuner.  
●	 Develop an algorithm to precisely detect the fundamental frequency of a selected guitar string from its frequency spectrum using the following methods.
●	Two methods for frequency detection:  
        1) Frequency domain 
       	2) Time domain.
